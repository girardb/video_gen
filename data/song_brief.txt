We are a team of archeo-mixologists and we're trying to trace back the origin of the mythic "PhilHappy" (pronounced Feel Happy) drink. In our research we've found that it is a drink that transcends time and that it was present for every important historical event. It is an orange drink that has an orange slice on the side of the glass. It is a kind of funny and absurdist concept. We're tracing back to the dinosaurs, their extinction and even before. To even events that will happen in the future. Like us meeting aliens, having a inter-planetary council, us fighting back against a mindless hive civilization (like the zergs), us fighting gods and etc.  To even events like the testing of the first nuclear bomb, Christopher Colombus arriving in America, release of the first iphone, etc... So it should be a bit upbeat, maybe electro a bit with good beats.
